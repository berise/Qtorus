# Warning
This is game is under development. Even master branch doesn't work.
But I'm expect this might get stable soon. Because it's port from wxTorus.(wxWidgets).

BTW, Sooo many were changed in Qt since ver 0.x, 2.x.

What is Qtorus
===============
Qtorus is a simple game inspired by Torus for DOS.  The object of Torus is to 
clear falling toruses by aligning toruses with the same color on one of several 
protruding pipes. 

How to play
-----------
Use your arrow keys in your keyboard and align your toruses in a row with same color.
I'll add VIM keys for vim lovers.

Space : to start or pause a game.
ESE to quit a game.

Build
-----
This is build to Qt 5.8 version. 
Install Qt first and qmake and make

HISTORY
-------
This game(torus) is initially started in 1998 with Qt(ver 0.98) cloning a dos game named Torus(R).
And I registered this project to sourceforce.net as a ktorus.
At that time, kde was massively developed and growing up to become a modern desktop environment.

Now it is being ported to Qt again.
