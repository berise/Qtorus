What is Qtorus
===============
Qtorus is a handy game inspired by Torus for DOS.  The object of Torus is to 
clear falling toruses by aligning toruses with the same color on one of several 
protruding pipes. 

Have you seen this game before? yes, it is a port of DOS(R) torus game.
Yes, yes, it's another port of [wxTorus](https://github.com/berise/wxTorus)

How to play
-----------
Use your arrow keys in your keyboard and align your toruses in a row with same color.
I'll add VIM keys for vim lovers.

Space : to start or pause a game.
ESE to quit a game.

Build
-----
Qtorus is currently using Qt 5.8 version.
So please install Qt first and qmake and make.
If you use QCreator then load qtorus.pro and build.

HISTORY
-------
This game(torus) is initially started in 1998 with Qt(ver 0.98) to run in X-Windows
as clone of a dos game named Torus(R). And then port it to Win32 with VWCL.
Later on, I port it to use wxWidget and named it kTorus registered
to sourceforce.net as a [ktorus](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ktorus).
